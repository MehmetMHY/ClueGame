- On Canvas, one of the possible extensions is to "Dynamically determining where to display the room name". We believe we did this, you can prove us wrong if you like. We did this in our DrawBoard class in the levelBoardRooms method. Here we have a series of loops that loop though each BoardCell on the board as well as each RoomName from the OurRooms text file. If a BoardCell's room type contains "X", then a label is created with the room's name and this name is placed where the room in on the GUI. This is all based on the CSV file and where the use placed Xs in that CSV file. Also note that the roomTypes do not just have Xs rather it has the roomType for that room and the second char is an X. We hope this meets the "Awesome Points" requirements and we are grateful for any "Awesome Points". If you have any questions, please contact use from Canvas or our emails, thank you.
